#The geographical distances between municipalities and the linguistic distances. 
#Geographical distances are planar straight-line distances between municipal population centres (in metres).
# Linguistic distances are rough equivalents of Seguys dialect distance metric, 
# i.e. a percentage of disagreeing linguistic features between pairs of municipal dialects. 

#In the distance matrices there is only the project ID of each municipality present so on 
#the third sheet I put which project ID matches with which municipality.
